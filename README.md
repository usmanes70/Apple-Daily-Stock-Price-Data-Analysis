# Apple-Daily-Stock-Price-Data-Analysis
"AAPL", is the stock symbol for Apple Inc., an American multinational technology company that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. I have scraped the real-time data from Alpha Vintage API i.e. daily stock prices dataset of Apple licensed under NASDAQ using Python and do analysis in Excel. I have learned about how stock price variables are defined and analyzed. I have done exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics, the correlation between the variables, trend analysis, pivot table to know about the average prices and volume (i.e. Number of Shares), and hypothesis testing to find the impact of opening price on a number of shares.

<b>Tools that I used:
